description: Fix the failing CI checks on this branch's PR and push
argument-hint: "[which check, or extra guidance]"
---

CI is failing on this branch's pull request. Fix it.

1. List the checks: `gh pr checks`. For each failing one, read its logs
   (`gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`, or the check's link for external CI).
2. Find the cause. If it's a flaky or infrastructure failure unrelated to this
   change, rerun it (`gh run rerun <run-id> --failed`) instead of changing code,
   and say so.
3. Otherwise fix it, commit with a message starting with the ticket key from the
   branch name, and push.
4. Watch again: `gh pr checks --watch --fail-fast`. After three failed rounds,
   stop and summarise what's failing and why.

Don't change the PR's draft or ready state, request reviews or merge.
