  Push this branch, open a draft PR for its Jira ticket, and get CI green
argument-hint: "[anything to mention in the PR]"
---

Open a draft pull request for the work on this branch, then make CI pass.

1. Find the Jira ticket: the key in the current branch name (e.g.
   `lavigneer/WEB-142` → `WEB-142`). Read it with
   `jira issue view <KEY> --plain` for the summary.
2. Make sure everything is committed: review `git status` and `git diff`, and
   commit what belongs to the change with a clear message that starts with the
   key (`WEB-142: …`). Don't commit unrelated files.
3. Push: `git push -u origin HEAD`.
4. If a PR already exists for this branch (`gh pr view --json url,isDraft`),
   skip to step 5. Otherwise create it as a draft with `gh pr create --draft`:
   - Title: `<KEY>: <short summary of the change>`.
   - Body: what changed and why (a few bullets), how it was tested, and a link
     to the ticket (`jira open <KEY> --no-browser` prints its URL). Use the
     repo's PR template if it has one (`.github/pull_request_template.md`).
5. Wait for CI: `gh pr checks --watch --fail-fast`. If a check fails, read the
   failing logs (`gh run view <run-id> --log-failed`), fix the cause, commit,
   push, and watch again. After three failed rounds, stop and summarise what's
   failing and why.
6. Finish with the PR URL and the CI result.

Don't mark the PR ready for review, request reviewers or merge: that's left to
me.
